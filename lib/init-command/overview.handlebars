### Do this

The purpose of the _Do this_ sections in this module is to give you important hands-on experience. In these sections, you'll perform various tasks, like setting up a development environment or executing a command. Ultimately, these practice sections will help you successfully complete graded assignments, such as projects, mock interviews, and capstones. At the end of the module, you'll need to complete an assignment that allows you to leverage the skills and knowledge you have gained in the current module to solve a real-world engineering problem.
